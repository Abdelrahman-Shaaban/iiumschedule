  Assalamualaikum, are you an International Islamic University Malaysia student? If you are, then you knew that IIUM use a CRS (Course Registration Slip) or a Confirmation Slip to show the class schedule.
  <img class='screenshot' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;' src='/static/mainpage/crs.jpg'></img>
  But, the CRS is formatted in a way that make it cumbersome to see which class do you have on a particular day. That is, it does not arrange it in day-to-day basis. And so, due to my lazyness to reformat the schedule manually, I had make a website called Automatic IIUM Schedule Formatter. Basically, what this website does is that it reformat your CRS/Confirmation Slip into a schedule like this:
  <img class='screenshot' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;width:66%;height:66%;' src='/static/mainpage/after.jpg'></img>
  Of course, the design is not limited as the above only. You can customize your schedule according to your taste.
  <img class='screenshot' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;'  src='/static/mainpage/showstyler.jpg'></img>
  Automatic IIUM Schedule Formatter also has a theme gallery that allow you to change the style of your schedule without much knowledge about CSS or EJS template. But for now, not many themes are available, so If you are great at designing, feel free to submit your design.
  <img class='screenshot' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;'  src='/static/mainpage/submit.jpg'></img>
  <h2>Instruction</h2>
  <h3>For webkit based browser (Chrome or Safari):</h3>
  <div>
  <ol>
  <li>Copy EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER below:<br />
  <pre style='word-wrap:break-word;'><code>javascript:(function(){var e=document.createElement('script');e.src = 'https://iiumschedule.appspot.com/static/scheduleformatter.js';e.type='text/javascript';e.addEventListener('load',function(){startscheduler()} );document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(e);})();</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Open your Course Registration Slip (CRS)/Confirmation Slip at <a href="http://my.iium.edu.my/" target="_blank_">myiium</a>. Please make sure that you open the CRS on a new tab.</li>
  <li>Paste the code, and MAKE SURE IT START WITH 'javascript:'<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QFuUim02BmM/Twb86TNGQlI/AAAAAAAAANE/JnFSZ_6jrog/s1600/Selection_018.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="124" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QFuUim02BmM/Twb86TNGQlI/AAAAAAAAANE/JnFSZ_6jrog/s640/Selection_018.png" width="640" /></a></div>
  <strong>For Chrome: Google Chrome will automatically erase the "javascript:" portion of the code above. I recommend that you copy the code without "javascript:" and then type "javascript:" manually, then paste the rest of the code.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Wait... you will get a message saying "Saving your schedule...". Then it will say "Done! Please click this link.". So click the link.</li>
  </ol>
  <div>
  <br /></div>
  </div>
  <div>
  <h3>For Firefox:</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Right click link&nbsp;<a href="javascript:(function(){var e=document.createElement('script');e.src = 'https://iiumschedule.appspot.com/static/scheduleformatter.js';e.type='text/javascript';e.addEventListener('load',function(){startscheduler()} );document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(e);})();">Automatic IIUM Schedule Formatter</a>.</li>
  <li>Click "bookmark this link".</li>
  <li>Open your CRS as in the Google Chrome step <a href="http://my.iium.edu.my/" target="_blank_">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Click firefox bookmark menu, and click the bookmark that you had recently make.</li>
  <li>Wait... you will get a message saying "Saving your schedule...". Then it will say "Done! Please click this link.". So click the link.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Next</h3>
  <p>The link will open another page that allow you to customize your schedule.</p>
  <img src="/static/mainpage/afterbig.jpeg" style="width:800px"></img>
  <ul>
      <li>
          <h4>Choose Theme</h4>
          <p>
          You can choose several pre-made theme allthough it is not much and not really... pretty. So, in case if you had succeded in creating awesome design, please submit your design using the link given.
          <p>Tips: If you had mess up your schedule, you can reset by using the theme "default" of refresh the page</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h4>Settings</h4>
          <p>This page allow has some settings applicable for the schedule. Among those are show or hide the personal details and course, show or hide schedule for a particular days and also, enable or disable minute alignment tweaks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h4>Use Styler to design your schedule</h4>
          <p>AIIUMSF is equipped with a system (that I call) "Styler" that allow you to change font, alignment, color, shadow and other characteristic of your schedule without much knowledge about CSS or HTML. I suggest that if you are only interested in changing the color, just use the "Color" tab which already has some predefined color.  
          <p>Tips: <a href="/scheduleformatter/" target='_blank'>Click here</a> to see a demo using some dummy schedule </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h4>Edit CSS/Template(For Advanced user only)</h4>
          <p>AIIUMSF basically generate an HTML page containing your schedule. An EJS template determine the html layout. Styler is just a tool to modify the CSS. If you do not know what is CSS or HTML, you can just ignore this section. For webmasters that want extra control, you can edit the CSS and EJS Template manually. Just be carefull with the comment's generated by Styler in the CSS.</p>
             </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Saving Your Schedule</h3>
  <p>To save your schedule, just click on the "save" button at the top right of the page. A new page will appear saying that your schedule is ready. The page has two link, the first one is a link to your schedule. The second one is a a link to save your schedule as an image on Facebook. Unfortunately, the link to save it on Facebook is no longer functioning due to a technical problem that I can't fix. I just leave it there because I am a lazy person.</p>
  
  <h2>Disclamier</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
  First of all, I would like to say the the creation of this website has no connection with IIUM. Use at your own risk, allthough as far as I can tell, there are no risk whatsoever.
  </li>
  <li><strong>
  FOR MAIN CAMPUS IIUM USER: The use on Main Campus Student's Confirmation Slip had only recently been implemented and therefore are in testing phase. Student are encourage to test the schedule and send a bug report if you encounter any error or difficulties. Students are encourage to design your schedule using Styler and publish them for public use.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
  For main campus user also, a little tweak has been used to align the minute correctly. Unfortunately the tweaks work by adding another row to the table. The row has zero height (in theory), but this will cause the bottom border of the table to be a bit thicker. You can disable the tweak in the settings page.
  </li>
  <li>
  Whoever that is little computer savvy will notice that using this technique, you are using a Javascript Injection Attack to IIUM page. Why do you need to do so? Originally, I would prefer If you could just save the CRS and upload it to this website. Unfortunately IIUM portal security is a little bit cumbersome and therefore some hacking is required.
  </li>
  <li>
  For those who are not exactly "fluent" in this computer stuff, in simple word, If there are any particular person who asked you to do thing like this, and the source of the page is doubtful like "Facebook Unlike button" or "Win an Ipad 4!", DONT DO WHAT IT ASK YOU TO DO. Basically, it asked you to run some javascript from unknown sources and probably the javascript contain viruses and that is why there are virus on Facebook.
  </li>
  <li>
  For those who are interested on how does the program works, you are welcomed to reverse engineer the code, except for styler.js which is used on my other project that is <a href='http://yagregator.com'>YourAgregator</a>
  </li>
  <li>
  And by the way, because of various cross-domain scripting restriction, I have decided to take the easy way by tomporarily saving the schedule on the server. So, yes I can know you schedule if I know your name and I am interested in it. But no worry, the server will automatically delete your schedule at least in 48 hour. So, after you submitted your schedule, you  only have 24 hours to save you schedule. After 24 hour, there is a possibility that the link given will not work anymore. 
  </li>
