  <h1 class="page-header">Automatic IIUM Schedule Formatter</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>Assalamualaikum, are you an International Islamic University Malaysia student? If you are, then you knew that IIUM use a CRS (Course Registration Slip) or a Confirmation Slip to show the class schedule.</p>
  <img class='screenshot' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;' src='/static/mainpage/crs.jpg'></img>
  <p>But, the CRS is formatted in a way that make it cumbersome to see which class do you have on a particular day. That is, it does not arrange it in day-to-day basis. And so, due to my lazyness to reformat the schedule manually, I made a webapp called Automatic IIUM Schedule Formatter. Basically, what this website does is, it reformat your CRS/Confirmation Slip into a schedule like this:</p>
  <img class='screenshot' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;width:66%;height:66%;' src='/static/mainpage/after.jpg'></img>
  <p>Of course, the design is not limited as the above only. You can customize your schedule according to your taste.</p>
  <img class='screenshot' style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;'  src='/static/mainpage/showstyler.jpg'></img>
  <p>Automatic IIUM Schedule Formatter also has a theme gallery that allow you to change the style of your schedule without much knowledge about CSS or EJS template. Although currently there is only one design available. Feel free to submit your own design.</p>

          <h4>Choose Theme</h4>
          <p>
          You can choose several pre-made theme allthough it is not much and not really... pretty. So, in case if you had succeded in creating awesome design, please submit your design using the link given.
          <p>Tips: If you had mess up your schedule, you can reset by using the theme "default" of refresh the page</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h4>Settings</h4>
          <p>This page allow has some settings applicable for the schedule. Among those are show or hide the personal details and course, show or hide schedule for a particular days and also, enable or disable minute alignment tweaks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h4>Use Styler to design your schedule</h4>
          <p>AIIUMSF is equipped with a system (that I call) "Styler" that allow you to change font, alignment, color, shadow and other characteristic of your schedule without much knowledge about CSS or HTML. I suggest that if you are only interested in changing the color, just use the "Color" tab which already has some predefined color.  
          <p>Tips: <a href="/scheduleformatter/" target='_blank'>Click here</a> to see a demo using some dummy schedule </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <h4>Edit CSS/Template(For Advanced user only)</h4>
          <p>AIIUMSF basically generate an HTML page containing your schedule. An EJS template determine the html layout. Styler is just a tool to modify the CSS. If you do not know what is CSS or HTML, you can just ignore this section. For webmasters that want extra control, you can edit the CSS and EJS Template manually. Just be carefull with the comment's generated by Styler in the CSS.</p>
             </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Saving Your Schedule</h3>
  <p>To save your schedule, just click on the "save" button at the top right of the page. A new page will appear saying that your schedule is ready.</p>
  
  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
  First of all, I would like to say the the creation of this website has no connection with IIUM. Use at your own risk, allthough as far as I can tell, there are no risk whatsoever.
  </li>
  <li>
  For main campus user , a little tweak has been used to align the minute correctly. Unfortunately the tweaks work by adding another row to the table. The row has zero height (in theory), but this will cause the bottom border of the table to be a bit thicker. You can disable the tweak in the settings page.
  </li>
  <li>
  Also for main campus user, short sem Confirmation Slip has another format to describe the day for the schedule (the one like "TWTH" or "THF". The current code implimentation to parse that is in BETA state and does not support saturday and sunday. However if you encounter any error, please consider sending a bug report as that will help the development greatly.
  </li>
  <li>
  For those who are interested on how does the program works, you are welcomed to reverse engineer the code, except for styler.js which is used on my other project that is <a href='http://yagregator.com'>YourAgregator</a>. Basically this is a bookmarklets, which load another scripts which then scan the schedule and reformat it in the Styler.
  </li>
  <li>
  And by the way, because of various cross-domain scripting restriction, I have decided to take the easy way by tomporarily saving the schedule on the server. So, yes I can view you schedule if I know your name and I am interested in it. But no worry, the server will automatically delete your schedule at least in 48 hour. So, after you submitted your schedule, you  only have 24 hours to save you schedule. After 24 hour, there is a possibility that the link given will not work anymore. After 48 hour, your schedule had already been deleted from the server.
